# School_Distric_Analysis

We help Maria create a summary data frame in which we calculate the total number of students, the total for the school, we also analyze by type, budget, reading score and math score. Then we were able to understand what is the highest performance per school, how much money goes to each school, the average score in math and reading per grade, among other analyzes. To complete this process, we needed to clean the data and make sure everything was without any error so that our analysis could be reliable.

Unfortunately, Maria received a request from the School Board to replace the 9th grade Thomas High School math and reading scores with NaN, and repeat the same analysis as previously done.
